# Overview

## General
All Quant projects **must** follow these 3 general guidelines:

1. Open Source
    - Quant Projects should be built with Open Source development standards in mind.
2. Readability
    - Quant projects should uphold code readability in order to ease the costs of switching devs, adding/removing features, and integrating existing projects into new pipelines.
3. Abstractness
    - Quant projects should be abstract, meaning that all design choices should be able to be easily extended into any reasonable future direction for the project.
