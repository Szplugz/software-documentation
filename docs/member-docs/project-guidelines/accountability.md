# Accountability Guidelines

## Weekly Project Team Meetings
Each project team should meet **every** week. This is to ensure everyone on the team is kept up to date with progress and to hold all team members accountable.

## Weekly Director Check Ins
Every week, the senior architect or backend director will check in with the project lead to check the progress of the team. He will either request a writeup or hold a meeting in which the team lead and/or each member seperately will detail what they accomplished that week and what they hope to accomplish in the next week.
