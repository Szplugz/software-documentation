# Contacts

Avoid friction. If you don't know what you should be doing or how to do something ASK! If they don't respond to you within 1-2 days, move to the next source.

Here's the order of sources to ask questions:
- Google
- Your project discord channel
- Your project lead
- The senior architect
- The backend director
- The head of software
