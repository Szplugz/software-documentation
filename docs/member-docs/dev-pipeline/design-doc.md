# Design Document

The third stage of the development pipeline is the design document. The design document is a well-constructed highly specific document detailing the rationale behind all design choices regarding the project. This stage is completed after  meeting with the backend director and going over your design document.

**All design documents should have the following sections**
- Overview (What is the project?)
- Functionality (How does the project work?)
- Use Cases (How might someone use the project?)
- Implementation (How is the project structured? This should include an explanation of your chosen tech stack and why you chose it, an explanation of how your classes and components communicate, and an explanation of any complicated logic or processes you plan to create)
- Costs (Does your project require money to run? Estimate how much.)
- Permissions (What permissions do you need to build your project?)
- Future Scope (What is not in the current scope of you project but is something you considered when designing your project?)
- Responsiblities (Who is responsible for what on your team? Who is the designated project lead?)
- Approximate Timeline
