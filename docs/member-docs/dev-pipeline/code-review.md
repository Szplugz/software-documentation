# Final Code Review

The final code review is the last stage of the development pipeline. In this stage, the project team will explain their entire codebase in a code review session with the backend director in order to address concerns such as security, documentation, style, and abstractness. Assuming everything works smoothly, a pull request will then be sent to the public version of the project repository and the project will be pushed to production.
