# Overview

The goal of Quant's backend engineering development pipeline is to provide structure in how projects are ideated, developed, and pushed to production. Our pipeline mirrors common practices at leading technology coorperations across the globe with a few modifications to fit Quant's specific needs.

**The pipeline is as follows:**
1. [Ideation](ideation)
2. [Project Proposal](proposal)
3. [Design Document](design-doc)
4. [Minimum Viable Product](mvp)
5. [Final Code Review](code-review)
