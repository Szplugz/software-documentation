# Project Proposal

The second stage of the development pipeline is the project proposal. For every project this is a ~ 1 page markdown file written by a director or exec member that explains an overview of the project, the number of points the project is worth, the expected deliverables of the project, constraints, resources and any other helpful information to help create project design documents.

## Examples
[Quant API Project Proposal](../../project-docs/quant-api.md)
