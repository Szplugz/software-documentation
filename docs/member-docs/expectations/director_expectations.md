# Director Expectations

Directors have a different set of expectations that come with the elevated role. These expectations are baseline and in many cases are only here as a guideline. Your day-to-day job expectations will add on to these due to the nature of your role. Make sure to check in with your respective department heads to make sure you are fulfilling your requirements **twice** a semester.

## Applying for Director

Being a Director is the next step to being an executive. Your responsibilties are much more broad and you are given a lot of free reign in how you would like to run your section of the division. It is up to you to set boundaries, update your members, and oversee the projects they complete. As such, in your application we are mainly looking for prior experience and interest as a member and your ability to lead objectives.

### Application Requirements
