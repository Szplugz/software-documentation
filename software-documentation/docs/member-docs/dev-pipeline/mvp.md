# MVP

The fourth stage of the development pipeline is the MVP (minimum viable product). When this stage is completed, you should have a minimum viable version of your project that meets all specified requirements from the project proposal. Generally this stage is reiterated on multiple times before the project is ready to move onto the final stage.
