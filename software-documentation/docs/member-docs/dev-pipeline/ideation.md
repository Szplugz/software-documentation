# Ideation

The first stage of the development pipeline is ideation. Every project starts with someone proposing the idea! 

Here at Quant anyone can propose ideas for future projects. 

Common avenues to start your idea on the development pipeline include:
- discussing the idea at weekly quant software meetings
- direct messaging a director or exec member 

Note that if you propose an idea and we agree that it's good it doesn't mean that you should drop everything and work on it immediatly. Most likely it will be pushed into the development pipeline and scheduled in a future 5 week development cycle. Different projects are prioritized based on club need and impact.
